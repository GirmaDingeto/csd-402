*Create an abstract Division class with fields for a company's division name and

*Use a constructor in the superclass that requires values for both fields.
*Create two subclasses named InternationalDivision and DomesticDivision.
*The InternationalDivision class includes a field for the country in which the division is located, 
*a field for the language spoken, and a constructor that requires all fields when created.
*The DomesticDivision class includes a field for the state in which the division is located and a 
*constructor that requires all fields when created.
*Write an application named UseDivision that creates two instances of each of these concrete classes (4 total instances).
*Save the files as: Division, InternationalDivision, DomesticDivision, and UseDivision.
